# Changelog

## 0.1.4

- Add `<category>Movie</category>` when another category containing the word movie is detected. This is required by Channels to mark as a movie.

## 0.1.3

- Some programmes have both "previously-shown" and "premiere" tags, in that case we should strip the "premiere" tag. In order to get this to work, it is replaced with "<repeat>".

## 0.1.1

- SBS never contains "previously-shown" tags, so must be skipped.
